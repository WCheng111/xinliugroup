abstract:  We uncover the transverse Majorana spin polarization of a class of higher-order topological superconductors.
“Transverse” means that the spin polarization of the Majorana zero modes is perpendicular instead of parallel
with the applied magnetic field. With this novel Majorana spin property, we predict the spin-selective Andreev
reflection occurs at lead polarization perpendicular to the applied magnetic field, in sharp contrast to that in the
Majorana nanowire and vortex system. The induced topological Josephson φ0 junction shows the qualitative
difference from the topologically trivial Josephson φ0 junction and provides benefits in constructing all electronically
controlled Majorana networks for braiding. We thus provide a comprehensive scheme for probing
non-Abelian statistics in this class of higher-order topological superconductors with transverse Majorana spin
texture.
